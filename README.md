# The-Odin-Project
My personal journey through The Odin Project is documenting my growth as a web developer. This repo includes all the exercises, mini-projects, and full-stack projects Iâ€™ve completed while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and more. These projects were developed from the ground up, step by step.
